Didn't give up! I swear!

If you're an employer who happens to be looking at this miserable repo that appears abandoned, don't worry, it's still hot in my mind.

Currently on hold as I work in another project focussed on OpenGL. Will take everything I learn from that project and apply in this game engines rendering system that I am very excited to design
